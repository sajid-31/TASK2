Project Overview

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model to predict a continuous target variable. This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

Steps Involved:

Choosing a Dataset:

Select a dataset with continuous target variables. For this example, we'll use the "Boston Housing" dataset which is available in scikit-learn.

Loading and Exploring the Dataset:

Load the dataset and display basic information.

Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

Preprocessing:

Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Training the Model:

Train a simple linear regression model using the training data.

Evaluating the Model:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

Make predictions on the test set.

Visualizing Results:

Plot the regression line.

Visualize actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.
